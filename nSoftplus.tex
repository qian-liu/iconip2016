\section{Introduction}
Spiking Neural Network (SNN) has not achieved the recognition/classification performance of its non-spiking competitor, ANN.
How to map a well trained ANN to SNN is a hot topic in this field, especially using spiking neurons of biological scale.
\section{Related Works:How to map a well trained ANN to SNN.}
Theoretical analysis studies showed that, biologically plausible learning, e.g. Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) could approximate a stochastic version of powerful learning algorithms in machine learning, such as Expectation Maximization~\cite{nessler2013bayesian}, Contrastive Divergence~\cite{neftci2013event}, Markov Chain Monte Carlo~\cite{buesing2011neural} and Gradient Descent~\cite{o2016deep}.
The stochastic intrinsics come from the nature of the event-based spiking process which results in the harder learning mechanism comparing to the smoothly differentiable functions given by ANN.
Practically, these models use neurons and synapses far from biological means, and it remains a unsolved problem to catch up the equivalent rate-based solutions.
 
The offline training and mapping of an ANN to SNN, on the other hand, has reported 
near-lossless conversions and state-of-the-art classification accuracies.
This research aims to prove that SNNs are equally capable of pattern recognition comparing to their non-spiking rivals, and at the same time are more biologically realistic and energy-efficient.
Jug and et. al.~\cite{Jug_etal_2012} firstly proposed the use of Siegert function to replace Sigmoid activation function in RBM (Restricted Boltzmann Machine) training.
The Siegert units map incoming currents driven by Poisson spike trains to the response firing rate of a LIF (Leaky Integrate-and-Fire) neuron.
The ratio of the spiking rate to its maximum ($1/\tau_ref$) is the equivalent probability of a sigmoid neuron.
The loss of classification accuracy of the spiking DBN (Deep Belief Network)~\cite{o2013real} mainly lies in the different shape of the activation function.
A recent research~\cite{hunsberger2015spiking} simplified the neuron response function of noisy incoming current, Siegert function, by smoothing the non-noisy current function.
Using this Soft LIF response function in stead of ReLU (Rectified Linear Units) and trained with noisy input, the 4-layered spiking autoencoder reached 98.37\% accuracy on MNIST. 

Even better performances~\cite{cao2015spiking,diehl2015fast} have been carried out in Spiking ConvNet (Convolutional Network), which employed simple integrate and fire neurons.
The training only used ReLUs and zero bias to avoid negative outputs, and applied novel deep learning methods, for example: dropout, to increase the classification accuracy.
Normalising the trained weights to SNN was relatively trivial and obtained the accuracy.
The work has been extended to RNN (Recursive Nerual Network)~\cite{diehl2016conversion} and run on the neuromorphic hardware, TrueNorth~\cite{merolla2014million}.

%\section{Introduction}
%
%You are strongly encouraged to use \LaTeXe{} for the
%preparation of your camera-ready manuscript together with the
%corresponding Springer class file \verb+llncs.cls+. Only if you use
%\LaTeXe{} can hyperlinks be generated in the online version
%of your manuscript.
%
%The \LaTeX{} source of this instruction file for \LaTeX{} users may be
%used as a template. This is
%located in the ``authors'' subdirectory in
%\url{ftp://ftp.springer.de/pub/tex/latex/llncs/latex2e/instruct/} and
%entitled \texttt{typeinst.tex}. There is a separate package for Word 
%users. Kindly send the final and checked source
%and PDF files of your paper to the Contact Volume Editor. This is
%usually one of the organizers of the conference. You should make sure
%that the \LaTeX{} and the PDF files are identical and correct and that
%only one version of your paper is sent. It is not possible to update
%files at a later stage. Please note that we do not need the printed
%paper.
%
%We would like to draw your attention to the fact that it is not possible
%to modify a paper in any way, once it has been published. This applies
%to both the printed book and the online version of the publication.
%Every detail, including the order of the names of the authors, should
%be checked before the paper is sent to the Volume Editors.
%
%\subsection{Checking the PDF File}
%
%Kindly assure that the Contact Volume Editor is given the name and email
%address of the contact author for your paper. The Contact Volume Editor
%uses these details to compile a list for our production department at
%SPS in India. Once the files have been worked upon, SPS sends a copy of
%the final pdf of each paper to its contact author. The contact author is
%asked to check through the final pdf to make sure that no errors have
%crept in during the transfer or preparation of the files. This should
%not be seen as an opportunity to update or copyedit the papers, which is
%not possible due to time constraints. Only errors introduced during the
%preparation of the files will be corrected.
%
%This round of checking takes place about two weeks after the files have
%been sent to the Editorial by the Contact Volume Editor, i.e., roughly
%seven weeks before the start of the conference for conference
%proceedings, or seven weeks before the volume leaves the printer's, for
%post-proceedings. If SPS does not receive a reply from a particular
%contact author, within the timeframe given, then it is presumed that the
%author has found no errors in the paper. The tight publication schedule
%of LNCS does not allow SPS to send reminders or search for alternative
%email addresses on the Internet.
%
%In some cases, it is the Contact Volume Editor that checks all the final
%pdfs. In such cases, the authors are not involved in the checking phase.
%
%\subsection{Additional Information Required by the Volume Editor}
%
%If you have more than one surname, please make sure that the Volume Editor
%knows how you are to be listed in the author index.
%
%\subsection{Copyright Forms}
%
%The copyright form may be downloaded from the ``For Authors"
%(Information for LNCS Authors) section of the LNCS Website:
%\texttt{www.springer.com/lncs}. Please send your signed copyright form
%to the Contact Volume Editor, either as a scanned pdf or by fax or by
%courier. One author may sign on behalf of all of the other authors of a
%particular paper. Digital signatures are acceptable.
%
%\section{Paper Preparation}
%
%Springer provides you with a complete integrated \LaTeX{} document class
%(\texttt{llncs.cls}) for multi-author books such as those in the LNCS
%series. Papers not complying with the LNCS style will be reformatted.
%This can lead to an increase in the overall number of pages. We would
%therefore urge you not to squash your paper.
%
%Please always cancel any superfluous definitions that are
%not actually used in your text. If you do not, these may conflict with
%the definitions of the macro package, causing changes in the structure
%of the text and leading to numerous mistakes in the proofs.
%
%If you wonder what \LaTeX{} is and where it can be obtained, see the
%``\textit{LaTeX project site}'' (\url{http://www.latex-project.org})
%and especially the webpage ``\textit{How to get it}''
%(\url{http://www.latex-project.org/ftp.html}) respectively.
%
%When you use \LaTeX\ together with our document class file,
%\texttt{llncs.cls},
%your text is typeset automatically in Computer Modern Roman (CM) fonts.
%Please do
%\emph{not} change the preset fonts. If you have to use fonts other
%than the preset fonts, kindly submit these with your files.
%
%Please use the commands \verb+\label+ and \verb+\ref+ for
%cross-references and the commands \verb+\bibitem+ and \verb+\cite+ for
%references to the bibliography, to enable us to create hyperlinks at
%these places.
%
%For preparing your figures electronically and integrating them into
%your source file we recommend using the standard \LaTeX{} \verb+graphics+ or
%\verb+graphicx+ package. These provide the \verb+\includegraphics+ command.
%In general, please refrain from using the \verb+\special+ command.
%
%Remember to submit any further style files and
%fonts you have used together with your source files.
%
%\subsubsection{Headings.}
%
%Headings should be capitalized
%(i.e., nouns, verbs, and all other words
%except articles, prepositions, and conjunctions should be set with an
%initial capital) and should,
%with the exception of the title, be aligned to the left.
%Words joined by a hyphen are subject to a special rule. If the first
%word can stand alone, the second word should be capitalized.
%
%Here are some examples of headings: ``Criteria to Disprove
%Context-Freeness of Collage Language", ``On Correcting the Intrusion of
%Tracing Non-deterministic Programs by Software", ``A User-Friendly and
%Extendable Data Distribution System", ``Multi-flip Networks:
%Parallelizing GenSAT", ``Self-determinations of Man".
%
%\subsubsection{Lemmas, Propositions, and Theorems.}
%
%The numbers accorded to lemmas, propositions, and theorems, etc. should
%appear in consecutive order, starting with Lemma 1, and not, for
%example, with Lemma 11.
%
%\subsection{Figures}
%
%For \LaTeX\ users, we recommend using the \emph{graphics} or \emph{graphicx}
%package and the \verb+\includegraphics+ command.
%
%Please check that the lines in line drawings are not
%interrupted and are of a constant width. Grids and details within the
%figures must be clearly legible and may not be written one on top of
%the other. Line drawings should have a resolution of at least 800 dpi
%(preferably 1200 dpi). The lettering in figures should have a height of
%2~mm (10-point type). Figures should be numbered and should have a
%caption which should always be positioned \emph{under} the figures, in
%contrast to the caption belonging to a table, which should always appear
%\emph{above} the table; this is simply achieved as matter of sequence in
%your source.
%
%Please center the figures or your tabular material by using the \verb+\centering+
%declaration. Short captions are centered by default between the margins
%and typeset in 9-point type (Fig.~\ref{fig:example} shows an example).
%The distance between text and figure is preset to be about 8~mm, the
%distance between figure and caption about 6~mm.
%
%To ensure that the reproduction of your illustrations is of a reasonable
%quality, we advise against the use of shading. The contrast should be as
%pronounced as possible.
%
%If screenshots are necessary, please make sure that you are happy with
%the print quality before you send the files.
%\begin{figure}
%\centering
%\includegraphics[height=6.2cm]{eijkel2}
%\caption{One kernel at $x_s$ (\emph{dotted kernel}) or two kernels at
%$x_i$ and $x_j$ (\textit{left and right}) lead to the same summed estimate
%at $x_s$. This shows a figure consisting of different types of
%lines. Elements of the figure described in the caption should be set in
%italics, in parentheses, as shown in this sample caption.}
%\label{fig:example}
%\end{figure}
%
%Please define figures (and tables) as floating objects. Please avoid
%using optional location parameters like ``\verb+[h]+" for ``here".
%
%\paragraph{Remark 1.}
%
%In the printed volumes, illustrations are generally black and white
%(halftones), and only in exceptional cases, and if the author is
%prepared to cover the extra cost for color reproduction, are colored
%pictures accepted. Colored pictures are welcome in the electronic
%version free of charge. If you send colored figures that are to be
%printed in black and white, please make sure that they really are
%legible in black and white. Some colors as well as the contrast of
%converted colors show up very poorly when printed in black and white.
%
%\subsection{Formulas}
%
%Displayed equations or formulas are centered and set on a separate
%line (with an extra line or halfline space above and below). Displayed
%expressions should be numbered for reference. The numbers should be
%consecutive within each section or within the contribution,
%with numbers enclosed in parentheses and set on the right margin --
%which is the default if you use the \emph{equation} environment, e.g.,
%\begin{equation}
%  \psi (u) = \int_{o}^{T} \left[\frac{1}{2}
%  \left(\Lambda_{o}^{-1} u,u\right) + N^{\ast} (-u)\right] dt \;  .
%\end{equation}
%
%Equations should be punctuated in the same way as ordinary
%text but with a small space before the end punctuation mark.
%
%\subsection{Footnotes}
%
%The superscript numeral used to refer to a footnote appears in the text
%either directly after the word to be discussed or -- in relation to a
%phrase or a sentence -- following the punctuation sign (comma,
%semicolon, or period). Footnotes should appear at the bottom of
%the
%normal text area, with a line of about 2~cm set
%immediately above them.\footnote{The footnote numeral is set flush left
%and the text follows with the usual word spacing.}
%
%\subsection{Program Code}
%
%Program listings or program commands in the text are normally set in
%typewriter font, e.g., CMTT10 or Courier.
%
